# Phalcon Boilerplate Quickstart Guide

This short document will show you how to get the code working.
For a more detailed explanation and documentation visit
[the article series at ParticleBits][1].

## Step 1: Update your local config file(s)

Navigate to `app/config/env` and update the config files. To get
started you only need to update the local.ini file. Feel free to
add/remove/rename any file in this directory. The config files
in here are environment specific and extend the ini settings in
`app/config/config.ini`. You'll probably need to update the paths
and MySQL config at a minimum. Make sure the paths.hostname is
**without** the http://.

## Step 2: Run the install script

## Step 3: Run the SQL update script

## Test it out!
